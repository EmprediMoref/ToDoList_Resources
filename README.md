## Bundled Resources
 
This repo contains resources which are included with [ToDoList](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5371/ToDoList). This includes files for translation, XSL styles, sample tasklists, and themes.

Please use the Issue tracker in this repo for these resources, but post all general discussion to the [CodeProject forum](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5371/WebControls/#_comments).

#### Where to post comments, questions, issues, requests

- The [Resources issue tracker](../../issues) is specifically for issues, enhancement requests, and questions related to the resource files.
- The [ToDoList issue tracker](../../../ToDoList_Issues/issues) is for the ToDoList software itself. A [ToDoList_Issues repository](../../../ToDoList_Issues) is dedicated to all files and docs related to software issues. 
- The [Wiki issue tracker](../../../ToDoList_Wiki/issues) is just for the wiki, which has a [repository](../../../ToDoList_Wiki) entirely dedicated to nothing but documentation.

### Creating good issue reports
Please observe the following guidelines when creating a new report:

- Include the ToDoList version and your operating system and verion (Windows XP, 7.0, 8.1, ...).
- Be specific about how to recreate a problem. It is difficult to fix issues if they cannot be reproduced.
- Apply labels to the best of your ability to your reports to allow for easy filtering. But do not Assign issues to an individual, and do not set the milestone. Only Dan can assign tasks and determine if/when a change "might" make it into the code.
- Add a screenshot to your issue reports if it applies - a picture says a thousand words. Use whatever mechanism you prefer to get a screenshot. Save the image to your preferred image website (Dropbox, PhotoBucket, etc) - use a free site that does not require a login to access images. Get a direct link to your screenshot. See [this page](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to see the Markdown code to add an image into your Issue report. Or you can simply paste in the URL for anyone to click to get the image.
- Don't go overboard but you can also add [emoji](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/) to your Issues for emphasis. :thumbsup:

#### Wiki
The [ToDoList_Wiki](../../../ToDoList_Wiki/wiki) is in a separate repo, and is currently a Work In Progress, subject to rapid change and even to being moved.
The [ToDoList_Resources Wiki](../../wiki) may (not determined yet) document some of the files in this repo.

*2015-jul-10*
