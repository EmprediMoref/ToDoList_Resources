## ToDoList Resources for Translation and Issue Handling
 
This repo contains resources which are bundled with [ToDoList](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5371/ToDoList). The files are mainly here for translation. Please post all general discussion to the [CodeProject forum](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5371/WebControls/#_comments).

#### Reporting Issues
The [Issue tracker](../../issues) for this repo is for discussion of specific ToDoList Issues. Please apply labels to the best of your ability to your reports to allow for easy filtering.

It helps to add a screenshot to your issue reports (a picture says a thousand words). Use whatever mechanism you prefer to get a screenshot. Save the image to your preferred image website (Dropbox, PhotoBucket, etc) - use a free site that does not require a login to access images. Get a direct link to your screenshot. See [this page](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to see the Markdown code to add an image into your Issue report. Or you can simply paste in the URL for anyone to click to get the image.

And please don't go overboard but you can also add [emoji](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/) to your Issues for emphasis. :thumbsup:

#### Wiki
The [Wiki](../../../ToDoList_Wiki/wiki) is currently a Work In Progress, subject to rapid change and even to being moved. Please report issues to the [Issue tracker for the Wiki](../../../ToDoList_Wiki/issues).
